# Magic Hour

Simple film and TV set call sheet organizer. Lets you add PDF callsheets for shooting days, along with daily scripts and full script for the whole project. As a production manager, you can set up your callsheets and script and then export a `.magicHour` package for the full team.

## Creating a package manually

Magic Hour packages are basically plain zip files, and you can create the package manually if you want to automatize the process.

Create a folder called `Documents`, and name your daily files as `CallSheet_YYYY-MM-dd.pdf`, `DailyScript_YYYY-MM-dd.pdf` and `FullScript.pdf`. Change the extension from `.zip` to `.magicHour` and you have a working package, ready for delivery.

## Post-mortem

The app was a byproduct of my own feature film, because I wanted a simple app to keep the production documents always at hand. I also wanted to learn some SwiftUI, and for full transparency, some of the basic view code was generated using AI. It's mostly rewritten from scratch since then.

Unfortunately Magic Hour is only available for Apple devices. Fuck Apple, fuck all tech giants and fuck capitalism. If someone can port the app to some other native app format, feel free!
